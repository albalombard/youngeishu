 Edgar Degas. Edgar Degas, Young Spartans, 1860 Comment by the famous art critic Jeffrey Meyers to Edgar Degas’ painting Spartan Girls Provoking Boys (1860-62): "Four cheeky, aggressive, bare-breasted adolescent maidens, wearing short aprons open at the sides, challenge five naked boys to engage in a wrestling match or sexual combat. My relationship is on its last legs. My boyfriend has gotten into this dynamic where he provokes arguments and then flips it against me blaming me for causing them. I feel I'm going crazy because it's a mindfuck, I literally do nothing and out of nowhere we're in the middle of a huge argument where I'm the bad one but through the grace of his heart he'll forgive me if I give him a blowjob, which he knows I hate doing. I feel he's getting off in making me do something I don't Addiction took our mother slowly, rocked her through it and sung her to sleep sunk deep into the mattress on her bed. When her back teeth fell out she left them on the side of the bathtub. I was seven, and I kept them in a match box, the missing pieces of her kept safe, so she wouldn't be lost forever. So maybe one day we could put her back together. Our house fell down around us, and we tried our best to raise ourselves. The ceilings had water damage and the bottom stairs TLDR at the bottom- Well I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I’m pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. We have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees. The previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos When I was at university, my perception of happiness was based on graduating and quitting my "shitty" job at the local supermarket. When I started my corporate career, I found the FIRE movement, so that perception shifted to wanting to grow my bank account and retire early to work on my side hustle. When I did FIRE, I was so miserable, it almost broke my spirit. ------------------------------------------------------------ First I want to extend a big thank you to this community.

R.I.P Nipsey Hussle, 1985 - 2019 (https://www.rap-up.com/app/uploads/2018/03/nipsey-hussle-sound-bites-8.jpg) Post your favorite Nipsey. Hi y’all! It’s about 1:30 in the morning and I’m just climbing into bed. I needed a place to organize my thoughts and as a long time lurker here, I feel pretty safe letting you in on what just happened. My husband and I have been together 12 years. He was born and raised in an extremely rough area of the Midwest and as a young black man, he was affiliated with the wrong crowds. He left that life 25 years ago and has not looked back. All that to say, when I met him 12 years ago, he wasn’t Background The story I want to tell you is full of sadness and heartache. I started out life in poverty living with my parents in a house that had some wooden floors and mostly dirt floors. My mother has a long list of mental issues and my father was an alcoholic and thankfully not the abusive type. Me and my sister were taken from our home when I was 7 and she was 4. We got placed into the foster care system in Kentucky. I'm not going to use real names, but I will use the initials. While it's only been a few days since I posted I think I've been able to find myself in a better place, mentally speaking. I've done a vast amount of thinking and introspection. I had a lot to process. A lot to figure out. I believe I was in a bit of a panic when I posted. I feel calmer now since reading each and every comment. I know now more than ever that I was never meant to be a dad. I certainly never wanted to be dad. Yet here I am, a dad. That will never change. Warning…this is a very long post: “Aragorn brought his sword down on the youngling in a blood lusted rage. The cries of mercy fell silent upon the backdrop of his own madness. All around him the shire burned. All around him the lifeless bodies of the innocent lay strewn. In his mind he told himself this was liberation. In the truth of words yet to be written, this was a massacre.” Does anyone remember this passage from The Lord of The Rings: Return of the King? Specifically the chapter ‘The. I did it! I’m about to reveal a bunch of NEW major 'COADM' and 'EVERYBODY' spoilers that will finally help make sense of ‘COADM’ and its absolutely HUGE role and relationship with TITS, EVERYBODY, and the rest of the storyline. I’m going to give the facts first! Not theories. I haven't seen anyone post what I'm about to say and this post reveals a LOT. Try not to skip any parts because you may need to read everything to fully understand what I think Logic and his team are doing. So recently I’ve had one Entitled Parent experience that lasted two months and now this. My family is renting our house in Minnesota so that we can stay in Maryland while my Grandfather recovers from a heart attack. Anyways we are packing things up with one of my friends and there is a loud banging on the door. I look through the peephole A woman in her forties with the cut, and the shades is there. I opened the door Me: Hello Ma’am can I help you? EM: Yeah, this house is for rent and it’s. It was stupid and immature. I'll be the first to admit that. But it's not like I killed anyone. And if you want to try to understand things from my perspective, there was really no way that I could not do it. First, because his name was Mr. Hillrow. Second, because he acted like a dick, always calling on you the one day you didn't do the reading, and then dragging out the torture in front of the whole class. Third, he sort of looked like a dick, with his ring of puffy hair surrounding. This is something that was super traumatic for me. But it was never discussed again in my household. I was talking with my Mom about it the other night and she still didn't say much. Thought I would share my thoughts with you all. When I was 13 I got a dell desktop for school. The internet was fairly new for me back in 2003. Aol and myspace. Yahoo messenger. Aol chatrooms. 16/f/cali anyone? Aol chatrooms was where I went. I was a shy, overweight kid back then. Still shy to this day. But online.
