                            <p> Hi there! I'm really new to development with Voxels and I was wondering if anyone got sources/projects to help me get started with Voxlap. I've chosen that particular engine because I like the looks of what it renders. Game examples are overly appreciated. Hello. I have tried OpenSpades and it is terribly laggy and horrible. But on my other computer, using the normal voxlap client is easier. I would like to know if there was a way for the voxlap launcher to be available for ubuntu without using emulators. I have been doing research into voxel engines like Voxlap ( and while it's easy to find out that these types of systems use ray casting, I haven't been able to find any resources that would give me an idea of how to go about implementing something similar. I want to explore game development in a voxel engine like this, but I need an idea of how to implement this type of voxel engine. Does anyone know where I might find more about the algorithms that are behin. Just thinking about Download (src + server files + Win32 build): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32094129/iceball/iceball-0.2.1.zip If that breaks, try this build: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32094129/iceball/iceball-indev-0.2.1-5.zip If THAT breaks, try this build: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32094129/iceball/iceball-indev-0.2a-6.zip Git repo: https://github.com/iamgreaser/iceball/ You should be using the git repo's pkg/ files if you're hosting your own server - we tend to change things. 
PND3D: /r/VoxelGameDev discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/VoxelGameDev/comments/2988uf/ken_silverman_releases_successor_to_voxlap_pnd3d/. As I understand the Wave Surfing algorithm (i.e. this ( one wave per on-screen column is traced, keeping track of the minimum and maximum vectors that are unobscured by the already drawn voxels. My issue is this: When you encounter a point where the wave "splits", e.g. in a room-over-room situation, or when looking through a grate (http://www.visualwalkthroughs.com/halflife2/enta. It's been another 2 weeks in the world of Voxels! Just last week Ken Silverman released his PND3D source code ( have you had a chance to look through it or toy with it yet? Share what you've accomplished and what you have in the pipeline. Since 1995 I have been working on various technologies for rendering voxels. I have decided to share the code and uploaded it to GitHub. Feel free to browse through and test the different technologies: 1996 : Pulsar, a heightmap tile based Voxel Engine in ASM/PAS (https://github.com/sp4cerat/Pulsar-Voxel-Engine-1996) 1997 : 1K-3D Engines : Voxel Engines in lt1024 Bytes Pascal code (https://github.com/sp4cerat/1K-3D-Voxel-Engines-1990s-) 2004 : HVox : Procedural Voxel Terrain Engine. Those who want to do something about the game, but don't want to put work into something that might fail are all the mediocres. And the hemorrhoids littering the community are the guys who think it's impossible and try to tell people to give up. I got some good proof of growth in the community and the boost of players that can come of work. Does anyone know the RTS famous for its realism and physics in 1998? Total Annihilation, and it has been around so long with tournaments and big games still. I know it's been 2 weeks since the last update and the main cause for that is the fact that nearly all of the code is being modified. Right now I'm currently digging into the save format of worlds. When a multiplayer match is started, only the server is required to have the world file on hand. Because of this players aren't required to go and download the file before entering the match to help reduce non-needed steps. This lead into issue #1. What I thought were small files turned Note, I know that the Voxlap version is called "Ace of Spades". When I say "Build and Shoot", I am referring to the website and community and stuff. It's been known that Build and Shoot's player count tends to only go up when the Jagex version's player count spikes up due to a steam sale and then follows a rather familiar decay function (after accounting for "seasonal variance" (the weekends and the times of day), of course). After Jagex's players start spilling into the "free version", BnS's. Hi, I've been playing the original Ace of Spades since early Beta. Not trying to impress anybody, but I just want to convince you guys I've been hanging around since the start, pretty much. DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU'VE ENJOYED THE OLD VERSION. IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL ACE OF SPADES (BETA), AND JAGEX HAS RUINED IT COMPLETELY. After the main dev bcoolface sold his game over to Jagex Studios (a.k.a the company best known for "Runescape"), they've flipped the game around, essentially 
For all of you doubting the ‘destroy anything’ capabilities. yeah that’s because we have heard it before. Red faction, anyone? The reason for that before, mostly, was the fact that those games use polygons and inherent destructibility is REALLY hard to handle because the more you break things up, the more you have to render. The big difference here is the voxels. Increasing the complexity doesn’t increase the graphics processing at all. It’s sort of hard to explain without knowing programming. Revolver: Pretty weird, but fun. Borderline HD: What the fuck. Transposer: Brain crusher. Candy Worm: Im not kidding, this game have a GREAT potential to be an horror game. Renegade Action Comando: Smells like an Flash Game, but with a lot of bugs. Space Usurper: Touhou and Shadow of the Colossus had a son, but he has been adopted by Voxlap Engine. Pressure Chamber: Infinite Super Meat Boy. ShinySphere: The best of all, need Oculus Rift support. Does anyone have any idea when v1.0 (or whatever the next update will be) comes out? I've been reading all these updates from bcoolface and matpow2 on the website about MGs and RPGs and opengl and everything, but I've never seen a date for all this madness. EDIT: I have more info, and my friends, it isn't good. Ben and Mat^2 have been busy. Two updates are coming out, Beta .76 AND Beta 1.0, weird right? 1.0 is going to be the OpenGL client (which means it has different, shinier graphics Hello, I'd like to tell you about the little indiegame AoS 0.75, why do I include 0.75 you might ask well, jagex owns the 1.0 version, while the 0.75 remained free, this also includes 0.76. And if you've played the 1.0 (steam version), I can tell you now that the 0.75 version is completly different. Text that is just info, not necesery to read STARTS HERE. The game is best described as a mix between battlefield and minecraft. You can build, shoot and add mods. There's tons of gamemodes. </p>
